     <p>Now as much as software developing has become a part of my life.I'd very much like to describe photography as an art to me.Photography isn't just about taking pictures, it does much more like describing something.Through photos some people get inspired and motivated, others get the urge to do the job, well others just do it for the fun of it.But as for me photograpy has taught me to express myself in various ways such as sending out a plee for the poverty in different parts of the country.Pretty much sends out an important information to the world and mostly the government out there so that they could help out wherever they can.

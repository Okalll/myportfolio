        <p>As a Software Developer, just like other Developers we all would like to showcase our work by putting ourselves our there in the market for different purposes, could either be careers search or selling out the projects we come up with.Reason why i came up with this portfolio is to open up to other developers in terms of what I can do usings the capacity of my skills and knowledge.<br>
        Apart from showcasing some of the projects, I am passionate about implementing SOLID principles and Design Patterns and I am constantly looking for better ways to utilize them in my personal and professional life.We could say coding is all about playing with codes in a rather skillful way...Playing with styles and all in a creative way ending up with impressive products in the end.</p>
